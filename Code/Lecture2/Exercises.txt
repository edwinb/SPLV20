Today's exercises:

* Complete the missing definitions in Core.TT

These might take you a while (they took me a while at first...) and there
is no need to complete them before the rest of the lectures. I suggest
you at least try to make some progress on one of them to get a feel for how
Term manipulation works, and look at the TinyIdris definitions if you get
stuck.

Some hints:

- You will need to manipulate IsVar in various ways, so don't be afraid of
  adding auxiliary definitions
- Sometimes when manipulating variables you will need to look at the names in
  scope to work out where to insert/drop a variable, so you may need 'vars'
  to be available at run time (it's not as expensive as you might expect)
- (In my opinion) contract is probably easiest, then subst; embed; weaken in
  increasing order of difficulty
- The answers are available in Core.TT in TinyIdris!
